Installation is easy; cd to the src/ directory, then type this:

./configure

make

make install

If this went without errors or serious warnings type this to start tintin:

tt++

You might need to compile and install the following libraries:

pcre: http://pcre.org
zlib: http://zlib.net


Options configure currently supports:

--enable-big5   To use the big5 encoding for Chinese characters.

If you wish, you can edit src/Makefile.in before running ./configure.
It shouldn't be necessary unless you have some unorthodox request
(such as wanting to install tintin++ /usr/local).

If you have any trouble with installing/compiling tintin, you can ask for
assistance on the forum.


TERMINAL EMULATION:

In order to run tintin full featured you will need a vt100 emulator. If your
OS doesn't use one per default it's suggested to install xterm or rxvt (also
known as wterm).

STATIC LINKING:

This is more so a note to myself to statically link PCRE on Cygwin.

$ wget ftp://ftp.csx.cam.ac.uk/pub/software/programming/pcre/pcre-8.34.tar.bz2
$ tar xvf pcre-8.34.tar.bz2
$ cd pcre-8.34/
$ ./configure CC=i686-pc-mingw32-gcc CXX=i686-pc-mingw32-g++ --enable-jit --enable-unicode-properties --disable-shared
$ make
$ ./configure --libdir='../pcre-8.34' --includedir='../pcre-8.34'
